#Churn_Prediction
Churn Prediction is a problem that is faced by brands across multiple domains such as E-Commerce and Telecom Industry. 
It is basically the process of losing customers to competition or due to some other factor. 
This is a classification problem where the target variable is a two class variable with values Yes or No. 
The independent variables could be a mix of categorical or numeric variables. 
We will apply multiple pre-processing techniques, exploratory data analysis and machine learning algorithms to predict and 
reduce churn in this project.
